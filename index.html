        <h2>Freelance Graphic Designer</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freelance graphic designer from Roanke, VA. I am happy to take your inquiries as soon as I graduate in May 2023.</p>
         <p>
            My Instagram and portfolio are at this link <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aliciajoydesign/">website</a> and I am currently working on a more aesthetically pleasing website, this is just filler until that happens.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I am also an intermediate photographer and I can shoot products for marketing if that is something your company would need. 
         </p>
